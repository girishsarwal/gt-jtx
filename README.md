I feel it's cool to control an airplane with a 3d joystick rather than gimbals. 
It's intuitive and real aircraft pilots (or those trained on MSFS) can appreciate. See Yoke and HOTAS ("Hotass")
After a good amount of self provocation, I embarked on the journey of doing a joystick based 4 analog and 1 digital channels transmitter for controlling Airplanes. 
Additionally, this system needs to have a basic menu system, settings (Expo/Dr, Rev etc..) and a monitor
