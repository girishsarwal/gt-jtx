What is gt-jtx?
I feel it's cool to control an airplane with a 3d joystick rather than gimbals. It's intuitive and real aircraft pilots (or those trained on MSFS) can appreciate. See Yoke and HOTAS ("Hotass")

After a good amount of self provocation, I embarked on the journey of doing a joystick based 4 analog and 1 digital channels transmitter for controlling Airplanes. Additionally, this system needs to have a basic menu system, settings (Expo/Dr, Rev etc..) and a monitor

# How does it work?
The gt-jtx uses a 3d joystick for controlling an RC airplane. The X axis map to ailerons (roll), Y to Elevator (pitch) and the joystick grip twist/Z axis map to Rudder (Yaw) control. The throttle control has a separate pot on the base of the joystick. Digital push buttons 5-12 on the joystick base are trim switches for the four channels and pressing unique combos on these switches along with power switch navigates through the menu and settings screen.

# Variants
There are three variants of the gt-jtx in order of ease of development

- Arduino Mega - V1.2 available - Open TX
- ATMEGA 8 - V1.0 available - Custom firmware
- ATMEGA 32 - Work under progress

See the wiki for more details
